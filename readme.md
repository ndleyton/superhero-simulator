# Superhero simulator

## Assumptions

- Damage is done as an int
- Each Superhero has one (AS) Actual Stamina and one random element of FB chosen that's static
- Eo make it so one team does not always have an advantage, the superhero attacking between Team 1 and Team 2 is randomized

## Notes
- https://superheroapi.com is slower than https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/, development was done with the latter
